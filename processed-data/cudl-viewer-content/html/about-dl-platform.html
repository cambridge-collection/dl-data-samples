<h2>Cambridge Digital Collection Platform</h2>
<hr class="cam-teaser-divider campl-column12">


<p>With generous support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the
    Polonsky Foundation, the Cambridge University Digital Library began
    its journey in 2010, seeking to represent some of the world's
    invaluable special collections by opening up knowledge, to the
    widest possible audience, for research, education, simple curiosity
    or simply to enjoy.<br>

    <br>

    Over the years, more than Â£2 million has been invested in this
    endeavour, with contributions from specialist photographers,
    curators and subject matter experts providing rich content
    contained within a purpose built platform created by a team of
    in-house developers at Cambridge University Library. The <a href=
                                                                        "https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University Digital
        Library</a> is a well-loved innovative, world-class resource for
    everyone.<br>

    <br>

    Cambridge University Library is now taking another step forward in
    our mission: &#160;</p>

<ul>
    <li>&#160;&#160; to provide more <strong>access</strong> to world
        heritage collections</li>

    <li>&#160;&#160; to <strong>collaborate</strong> with partners to
        share the benefits and maximise reach and impact</li>

    <li>&#160;&#160; to <strong>engage</strong> people and
        <strong>inspire</strong> thirst for knowledge and understanding.
        &#160;</li>
</ul>

<p><br>

    Our innovation is quite simple; we share the software platform,
    the Cambridge Digital Library Platform, that we have built to help
    many more Universities, Libraries, Museums and Galleries, so that
    they in turn can share their wonderful collections with the
    world.<br>

    The launch of the <strong>University of Manchester's Digital
        Collection</strong> (<a class="campl-external" title=

    is the result of a collaborative project between <strong>University
        of Manchester</strong> and <strong>Cambridge University
        Libraries</strong>.&#160; It represents the first step in our
    ambitious mission to share Cambridge's platform and build a strong
    community of developers, researchers and special collection
    experts, ultimately giving everyone the opportunity to experience
    the world's wonderful collections.</p>

<p><br>

    <strong>In 2020, the Cambridge Digital Collection Platform will be
        released</strong> as an open source software project to the
    community. &#160;<br>
